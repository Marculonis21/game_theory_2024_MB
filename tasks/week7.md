# Week 7 Homework

## 1) Conversion of Extensive-form Games to Normal-form Games
- Implement a function that converts an extensive-form game to an equivalent normal-form game
- Using the normal-form representation, find a Nash equilibrium of the original game using any of the algorithms we have implemented

## 2) Sequence Form Linear Programming
- Implement a function that finds a Nash equilibrium of an extensive-form game using Sequence Form Linear Programming

# Week 7 Tests

Tests for Week 7 will appear in `tests/test_week7.ipynb` once we finish implementing the reference solution.
